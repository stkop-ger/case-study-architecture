# 🚀 Senior Full Stack Engineer Case Study

## User Authentication Service

Welcome to the marta Senior Full Stack Engineer technical case study. This repository contains a boilerplate microservice architecture that you will use to implement a **User Authentication Service**.

---

## 📋 Overview

Your task is to build a fully functional user authentication service using the provided boilerplate. The service should handle user registration, authentication, and basic user management operations.

### Time Expectation
- **Estimated time:** 3-4 hours
- Focus on code quality over feature completeness

---

## 🎯 Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. User Registration
- Create an endpoint to register new users
- Required fields: `email`, `password`, `firstName`, `lastName`
- Email must be unique and validated
- Password must meet security requirements (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number)

#### 2. User Authentication
- Implement a login endpoint that accepts `email` and `password`
- Return a JWT token upon successful authentication
- Implement proper error handling for invalid credentials

#### 3. User Profile
- Create an endpoint to retrieve the authenticated user's profile
- Create an endpoint to update the user's profile (firstName, lastName)
- Endpoints should be protected and require valid JWT token

#### 4. Password Management
- Implement the `PasswordManagerService` to securely hash passwords using scrypt
- Implement password comparison for authentication

## 🏗️ Architecture

The boilerplate follows a clean architecture pattern with:

```
src/
├── controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
├── services/        # Business logic layer
├── repositories/    # Data access layer
├── entities/        # TypeORM entities
├── lib/             # Shared utilities and types
└── events/          # Event handlers (optional)
```

### Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework:** Express.js with inversify-express-utils
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **DI Container:** Inversify
- **Testing:** Jest with Supertest

## 📝 Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: User Entity
Complete the `User` entity in `src/entities/user.ts` with the following fields:
- `id` (UUID, auto-generated)
- `email` (string, unique)
- `password` (string, hashed)
- `firstName` (string)
- `lastName` (string)
- `createdAt` (timestamp)
- `updatedAt` (timestamp)

### Task 2: Password Manager Service
Implement the `PasswordManagerService` in `src/services/password-manager-service.ts`:
- `toHash(password: string)`: Hash a password with a random salt
- `compare(storedPassword: string, suppliedPassword: string)`: Compare a supplied password with a stored hash

### Task 3: User Repository
Implement the `UserRepository` in `src/repositories/user-repository.ts`:
- `findByEmail(email: string)`: Find a user by email
- `findById(id: string)`: Find a user by ID
- `create(userData: CreateUserDto)`: Create a new user
- `update(id: string, userData: UpdateUserDto)`: Update user data

### Task 4: User Service
Implement the `UserService` in `src/services/user-service.ts`:
- `register(userData: RegisterUserDto)`: Register a new user
- `authenticate(email: string, password: string)`: Authenticate user and return JWT
- `getProfile(userId: string)`: Get user profile
- `updateProfile(userId: string, data: UpdateProfileDto)`: Update user profile

### Task 5: User Controller
Implement the `UserController` in `src/controllers/user-controller.ts`:
- `POST /users/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /users/login` - Authenticate and get JWT token
- `GET /users/profile` - Get current user profile (protected)
- `PUT /users/profile` - Update current user profile (protected)

### Task 6: Authentication Middleware
Create a middleware to protect routes that require authentication:
- Validate JWT token from Authorization header
- Extract user information and attach to request
